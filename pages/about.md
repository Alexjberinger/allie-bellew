# About The Allie Bellew Collection
{% include feature/image.html objectid="alliebellew047" %}
## Bio
Allie Bellew is our earliest known North American woman comic artist. She published comics and cartoons in Harper’s Bazar, Harper’s Weekly, and elsewhere between 1872 and 1878. Although women were almost certainly drawing and publishing comics in North America prior to the 1870s, Allie is the first for whom we have reliable provenance. Allie was the daughter of the prolific comic artist Frank Bellew and older sister of “Chip” Bellew, another comic artist. While we do not know her exact birthdate, she was probably in her late teens and early twenties when the comics in this collection were drawn. Allie’s short career as a cartoonist ended near the time of her marriage. She died in childbirth in 1891.    
## Themes and Style
Although Allie was likely in the process of developing her artistic identity, she left behind a body of work, unique among American artists of the 1870s. Her works typically adopt the point of view of the women as they navigate life in domestic and public spaces—a rarity even for comics that appeared in women’s magazines like Harper’s Bazar. Her comics feature banter among female friends, struggles with unruly children and daft husbands, and meditations on housekeeping, fashion, and aging.
